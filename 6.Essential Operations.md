# Introduction

## Essential Operations
Constructors, destructors, and copy and move operations should be treated as a set.

```cpp
class X {
	X(Sometype);            // "ordinary constructor": create an object
	X();                    // default constructor
	X(const X&);            // copy constructor
	X(X&&);                 // move constructor
	X& operator=(const X&); // copy assignment: clean up target and copy
	X& operator=(X&&);      // move assignment: clean up target and move
	~X();                   //destructor: clean up
}
```

Situations in which an object can be copied or moved:
1. As the source of an assignment
2. As an object initializer
3. As a function argument
4. As a function return value
5. As an exception

In principle the 1st case uses a copy or move assignment, while the others a copy or move constructor.To optimize a copy or move constructor invocation, construct the object right in the target object. For example:

```cpp
X make(sometype);
X x = make(value);
```
Here, the compiler will eliminate one copy.

The constructors are used to:
1. Initialize a named object (ordinary constructor)
2. Initialize object on the free store (ordinary constructor)
3. Initialize temporary object
4. Implement explicit type conversion

Apart from the ordinary constructor, there are some others. We can explicitly declare them as default implementations, so as the compiler will not generate other default definitions.

```cpp
class Y{
	Y(Sometype)
	Y(const Y&)=default; // Default copy constructor
	Y(Y&&)=default;      // Default move constructor
	// ...
}
```
When a class has a __pointer member__, it is usually a good idea to be explicit about copy and move operations. When the pointer shows to something that the class needs to __delete__, the default memberwise copy could be wrong. Alternatively, it could show to something that mustn't be deleted.

__Rule of thumb__ (also called _rule of zero_): Either define all of the essential operations or none (using the default for all).

The complement of `=default` is `=delete`, which indicates that an operation is not to be generated (e.g. constructor of a base class). If this will be attempted, then a compile-time error will be raised.

## Conversions
For example the class __complex__ converts a double to a complex type.
```cpp
complex z1 = 3.14; // z1 becomes {3.14, 0.0}
```
This is called _implicit_ conversion. But it's not always the case.
If we want to convert an __int__ type to __vector__ type, then we can't do it implicitly, but like this:
```cpp
class Vector{
public:
	explict Vector(int s);
	// ...
};
```

## Member Initializers
With _default member initializer_ we ensure than no member will be left uninitialized.
```cpp
class complex{
	double re = 0;
	double im = 0;
public:
	complex(double r, double i): re{r}, im{i} {}
	complex(double r): re{r} {}
	complex() {}
};
```

# Copy and Move

The default way of copying an object is __memberwise__: copy each member.

```cpp
void test(complex z1){
	complex z2 {z1};
	complex z3;
	z3 = z2;
};
```

We must always consider this functionality, when we design a class.

|sophisticated concrete types|maybe not|
|abstract types|never|

## Copying Containers
_Resource handle_: A class is responsible for an object accessed through a pointer.

When a class is a __resource handle__, then the default memberwise copy is __disaster__. It would violate the handle's [invariant](4.Error%20Handling.md).

The __vector__ is considered a container, thus a concrete type. But a memberwise copy wouldn't work.

```cpp
void bad_copy(Vector v1){
	Vector v2 = v1; // copy v1's representation into v2
	v1[0] = 2;      // v2[0] is now also 2!
	v2[1] = 3;      // v1[1] is now also 3!
}
```
If the destructor of one of the v1, v2 is to be called, then there will be a problem. This should be taken in consideration when defining the _copy constructor_ or the _copy assignment_.

```cpp
class Vector{
public:
	explicit Vector(int s);             // constructor
	~Vector() { delete[] elem; };       // destructor
	Vector(const Vector& a);            // copy constructor
	Vector& operator=(const Vector& a); // copy assignment
	double& operator[](int i);
	const double& operator[](int i) cost;
	inst size() const;
private:
	inst sz;
	double* elem; // elem points to an array of sz doubles
};
```

```cpp
Vector::Vector(const Vector& a) // copy constructor
	:elem{new double[a.sz]},    // allocate space for elements
	sz{a.sz}
{
	for (int i=0; i!=sz; ++i)   //copy elements
		elem[i] = a.elem[z];
}
```
Now we allocate space and create copies.

```cpp
Vector& Vector::operator=(const Vector& a) // copy assignment
{
	double* p = new double[a.sz];
	for (int i=0; i!=a.sz; ++i)
		p[i] = a.elem[i];
	delete[] elem; // delete old elements
	elem = p;
	sz = a.sz;
	return *this;
}
```
`this` points to the object for which the member function is called.
Now, if a an exception is thrown, The old value of the __Vector__ is preserved.

## Moving Containers
Copying with copy constructor or copy assignment is costly for large containers `->` pass objects by reference. __But__ you cannot `return` a reference to a local object (the caller will destroy it).

Bad example, we copy __Vector__ at least twice (plus one for every operand), and `res` is completely useless afterwards:
```cpp
Vector operator+(const Vector& a, const Vector& b)
{
	if (a.size()!=b.size())
		throw Vector_size_mismatch{};

	Vector res(a.size());

	for (int i=0; i!=a.size(); ++i)
		res[i]=a[i]+b[i];

	return res;
}
```

In this case, we prefer __move__ to __copy__.
Move constructor:
```cpp
Vector::Vector(Vector&& a)
	:elem{a.elem}, // "grab the elements" form a
	sz{a.sz}
{
	a.elem = nullptr;
	a.sz = 0;
}
```
* `&&` `->` _rvalue reference_
* _lvalue_ `->` _something that can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment_
* _rvalue_ `->` complementary of _lvalue_ `->` _something you can't assigned to_ (e.g. an `int` return by a function call)
* _rvalue reference_ `->` a reference to something that nobody else can assign to `->` it would be safe to "steal" its value (e.g. the `res` in the 2nd previous code snippet)

A move constructor or assignment cannot take a `const` argument, they are supposed to steal it anyways.

move operation `->` _rvalue reference_ is used as initializer or right-hand side in an assignment. 

After this operation, the moved-from object should be in a state that allow the destructor to be run.

__Tip__: When we know that a value will not be used again, but the compiler isn't smart enough to figure it out by itself, we must be specific:
```cpp
Vector f()
{
	Vector x(100);
	Vector y(200);
	Vector z(300);
	z = x;            // we get a copy (x might be used later)
	y = std::move(x); // we get a move
	// better not use x here
	return z;
}
```

`std::move()` doesn't actually move anything. Instead it returns a reference to its argument to which we may move - an _rvalue reference_ (like cast).

Before `return` from f():
* z points where x used to point
* y is a copy of x
* x isn't pointing anywhere anymore (`nullptr`)

After `return` from f():
* __z__ is destroyed by `return` for going out of scope
* __y__'s destructor will __delete[]__ its elements.

__Tip__: move assignments can be critical for __performance__.

# Resource Management

# Operator Overloading

We can give meaning to operator for user-defined types - It's called _operator overloading_. When we use one operator, there must be a correct implementation that does the work.

It's not possible to define new operators, like `^^`, `**`, `===`, `$`, or unary `%`.

The overloaded operator should keep the same semantics!

Operators that can be overloaded for user-defined types (classes and enumerations):

|||
|---|---|
|Binary and arithmetic operators|`+ - * / %`
|Binary logical operators|`& \| ^(bitwise exclusive or)`|

# Advice
1. Control construction, copy, move, and destruction of objects.
2. Design constructors, assignments, and the destructor as a matched set of operations.
3. Define all essential operations or none.
4. If a default constructor, assignment, or destructor is appropriate, let the compiler generate it.
5. If a class has a pointer member, consider if it needs a user-defined or deleted destructor, copy and move
6. If a class has a user-defined destructor, it probably needs user-defined or deleted copy and move
7. By default, declare single-argument constructors __explicit__.
8. If a class member has a reasonable default value, provide it as a data member initializer.
9. Redefine or prohibit copying if the default is not appropriate for a type.
10. Return containers by value (relying on copy elision and move for efficiency).
11. Avoid explicit use of std::copy().
12. For large operands, use __const__ reference argument types.
13. Provide strong resource safety; that is, never leak anything that you thing of as a resource.
14. If a class is a resource handle, it needs a user-defined constructor, a destructor, and non-default copy operations.
15. Manage all resources - memory and non-memory - resources using RAII.
16. Overload operations to mimic conventional usage.
17. If you overload an operator, define all operations that conventionally work together.
18. If you define `<=>` for a type as non-default, also define `--`.
19. Follow the standard-library container design.
