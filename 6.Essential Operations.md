# Introduction

## Essential Operations
Constructors, destructors, and copy and move operations should be treated as a set.

```cpp
class X {
	X(Sometype);            // "ordinary constructor": create an object
	X();                    // default constructor
	X(const X&);            // copy constructor
	X(X&&);                 // move constructor
	X& operator=(const X&); // copy assignment: clean up target and copy
	X& operator=(X&&);      // move assignment: clean up target and move
	~X();                   //destructor: clean up
}
```

Situations in which an object can be copied or moved:
1. As the source of an assignment
2. As an object initializer
3. As a function argument
4. As a function return value
5. As an exception

In principle the 1st case uses a copy or move assignment, while the others a copy or move constructor.To optimize a copy or move constructor invocation, construct the object right in the target object. For example:

```cpp
X make(sometype);
X x = make(value);
```
Here, the compiler will eliminate one copy.

The constructors are used to:
1. Initialize a named object (ordinary constructor)
2. Initialize object on the free store (ordinary constructor)
3. Initialize temporary object
4. Implement explicit type conversion

Apart from the ordinary constructor, there are some others. We can explicitly declare them as default implementations, so as the compiler will not generate other default definitions.

```cpp
class Y{
	Y(Sometype)
	Y(const Y&)=default; // Default copy constructor
	Y(Y&&)=default;      // Default move constructor
	// ...
}
```
When a class has a __pointer member__, it is usually a good idea to be explicit about copy and move operations. When the pointer shows to something that the class needs to __delete__, the default memberwise copy could be wrong. Alternatively, it could show to something that mustn't be deleted.

__Rule of thumb__ (also called _rule of zero_): Either define all of the essential operations or none (using the default for all).

The complement of `=default` is `=delete`, which indicates that an operation is not to be generated (e.g. constructor of a base class). If this will be attempted, then a compile-time error will be raised.

## Conversions
For example the class __complex__ converts a double to a complex type.
```cpp
complex z1 = 3.14; // z1 becomes {3.14, 0.0}
```
This is called _implicit_ conversion. But it's not always the case.
If we want to convert an __int__ type to __vector__ type, then we can't do it implicitly, but like this:
```cpp
class Vector{
public:
	explict Vector(int s);
	// ...
};
```

## Member Initializers
With _default member initializer_ we ensure than no member will be left uninitialized.
```cpp
class complex{
	double re = 0;
	double im = 0;
public:
	complex(double r, double i): re{r}, im{i} {}
	complex(double r): re{r} {}
	complex() {}
};
```

# Copy and Move

The default way of copying an object is __memberwise__: copy each member.

```cpp
void test(complex z1){
	complex z2 {z1};
	complex z3;
	z3 = z2;
};
```

We must always consider this functionality, when we design a class.
