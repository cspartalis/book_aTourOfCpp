# Introduction
---
The most important step to clearly define the interactions among C++ components (functions, user-defined types, class hierarchies, templates) is to distinguish between the interface to a part and its implementation.

One entity can have many declarations, but only one definition.

---
# Separate Compilation
---
It can be done in 2 ways:
- Place declarations in separate files, called _header files_, and `#include` them where needed.
- Define _module files_, compile them separately, and `import` them where neede.

Cons:
- Minimize compilation time
- Separate logically distinct parts `->` less error
	-_code hygiene_ (cute term ><)

_Library_: collection of separately compiled code fragments (e.g. functions)
