# Programs

C++ is a _compiled_ language: Many source files are being compiled and object files are created. Then these object files are linked with a _linker_ and and executable program is created.

These executable programs are software/hardware dependent, so they aren't portable, but the source files are.

The ISO C++ defines:
- Core _language features_, such built-in types (e.g. char, int) and loops (e.g. for, while)
- _Standard-library components_ such as containers (e.g. vector, map) and I/O operations (e.g. << and getline())

C++ is _statically typed_ language, the type of every entity must be known to the compiler beforehand.

C++ std library components are written mainly in C++ with minor use of machine code (e.g. for thread context switching, check [[i.Appendix#Thread Context Switch vs Process Context Switch]])
