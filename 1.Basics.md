# 1.1 Introduction

- Notation of C++
- C++'s model of memory
- Basic mechanisms for organizing code into a program

# 1.2 Programs


C++ is a _compiled_ language: Many source files are being compiled and object files are created. Then these object files are linked with a _linker_ and and executable program is created.

These executable programs are software/hardware dependent, so they aren't portable, but the source files are.

The ISO C++ defines:
- Core _language features_, such built-in types (e.g. char, int) and loops (e.g. for, while)
- _Standard-library components_ such as containers (e.g. vector, map) and I/O operations (e.g. << and getline())

C++ is _statically typed_ language, the type of every entity must be known to the compiler beforehand.

C++ std library components are written mainly in C++ with minor use of machine code (e.g. for thread context switching, check [[i.Appendix#Thread Context Switch vs Process Context Switch]])

## 1.2.1 Hello, World!

- Every program must have exactly one main()
- If no value is returned by main(), then success
- Nonzero value indicates failure

_String literal_ is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.

# 1.3 Functions

Function declaration:
- name of function
- type of returned value
- number and types of args

If function declaration isn't also definition, then the argument names are ignored.

More and shorter functions -> less errors

If there are 2 or more functions with the same name, then the compiler will choose the most suitable to invoke in each call.

_Function overloading_: multiple functions with the same name.

Functions with common name should implement the same semantics.

# 1.4 Types, Variables, and Arithmetic

| | |
| --- | --- |
|Type|Defines a set of possible values and operations|
|Declaration|A statement that introduces an entity into the program and specifies its type|
|Object|Some memory that holds a value of some type|
|Variable|A named object|

## 1.4.1 Arithmetic

Use single quote as a digit separator to make long literals more readable.

## 1.4.2 Initialization

Initialization with `{}` saves you from conversions that loose information.

---
# 1.5 Scope and Lifetime

A declaration introduces its name into a scope:
- Local: In a function or lambda
- Class: Member named if defined outside of any function, lambda, or enum class
- Namespace: If it is defined inside a namespace outside of all of the above

Global name when defined outside of all of the above

---
# 1.6 Constants

2 notions of immutability:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| const | _"I promise not to change"_ |
| constexp | _"To be evaluated at compile time"_ |

Functions evaluated by compiler must be defined as `constexp` or `consteval`.

---
# 1.7 Pointers, Arrays, and References

| | | | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|Operator|In declaration:|In an expression(rhs):|
|`[]`|_array of_||
|`*`|_pointer to_|_contents of_|
|`&`|_reference to_|_address of_|

A reference is like a pointer, BUT:
- You don't need to use `*` to access the value
- It can't show to different object after initialization

__Tip__: Using `const <type> <varName> &`, you:
1. Don't risk value modification
2. Get rid of cost of copy

## 1.7.1 The Null Pointer

1. Represents notion of _"no-object is available" _
2. Don't have an object to point to

One `nullptr` is shared by all pointer types.

__Tip__: Check if a pointer argument actually points to something.

In older code `0` or `NULL` are used instead of `nullptr`.

---
# 1.8 Tests

You can use switch, if, and for statements.

The _switch-statement_ tests a value against a set of constants.

---
# 1.9 Mapping and Hardware

_"A C++ implementation sees a machine's memory as a sequence of memory locations into which it can place (typed) objects and address them using pointers."_

## 1.9.1 Assignment

Assignment of built-in types is a simple machine copy operation.

Different objects are independent; if we want them to share a value, we must say so.

## 1.9.2 Initialization

_Initialization_: Make an uninitialized piece of memory into a valid object.

_Assignment_: For almost all types, the effect of reading from or writing to an uninitialized variable is undefined.

Fortunately, we cannot have an uninitialized reference.

# 1.10 Advice

(This section is copied from the original)

1. Don't panic! All will become clear in time.
2. Don't use the built-in features exclusively. Many fundamental (built-in) features are usually best used indirect through libraries, such as the ISO C++ standard library.
3. `#include` or (preferably) `import` the libraries needed to simplify programming.
4. You don't have to know every detail of C++ to write good programs.
5. Focus on programming techniques, not on language features.
6. The ISO C++ standard is the final word on language definition issues.
7. "Package" meaningful operations as carefully named functions.
8. A function should perform a single logical operation.
9. Keep functions short.
10. Use overloading when functions perform conceptually the same task on different types.
11. If a function may have to be evaluated at compile time, declare it `constexpr`.
12. If a function must be evaluated at compile time, declare it `consteval`.
13. If a function may not have side effects, declare it `constexpr` or `consteval`.
14. Understand how language primitives map to hardware.
15. Use digit separators to make large literals readable.
16. Avoid complicated expressions.
17. Avoid narrowing expression.
18. Minimize the scope of a variable.
19. Keep scopes small.
20. Avoid "magic constants"; use symbolic constants.
21. Prefer immutable data.
22. Declare one name (only) per declaration.
23. Keep common and local names short; keep uncommon and non-local names longer.
24. Avoid similar-looking names.
25. Avoid ALL_CAPS names.
26. Prefer the `{}`-initializer syntax for declarations with a named type.
27. Use `auto` to avoid repeating type names.
28. Avoid uninitialized variables.
29. Don't declare a variable until you have a value to initialize with.
30. When declaring a variable in the condition of an `if`-statement, prefer the version with the implicit test against `0` or `nullptr`.
31. Prefer range-for loops over for-loops with an explicit loop variable.
32. Use `unsigned` for bit manipulation only.
33. Keep use of pointers simple and straightforward.
34. Use `nullptr` rather than `0` or `NULL`.
35. Don't say in comments what can be clearly stated in code.
36. State intent in comments
37. Maintain a consistent indentation style.
