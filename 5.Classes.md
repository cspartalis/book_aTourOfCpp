# Introduction

This chapter provides an overview of:
- Ways of defining and and using _user-defined_ types.
- [Chapter 6](6.Essential%20Operations.md) presents constructors, destructors, and assignments. Also, the rules for using those to control the life cycle of objects and resource management.
- [Chapter 7]() introduces templates for parameterizing types and algorithms.
- [Chapter 8](): generic programming; general and most flexible interfaces.

These are the language facilities supporting _object-oriented programming_ and _generic programming_.

Chapters 9-18 present examples of standard-library facilities and their use.

## Classes

The _class_ is the central language feature of `C++`. It represents an entity in the code of a program.

A good program consists of a set of classes. Usually, classes is what the libraries offer. When having a good idea about the design of a program, you should write it down as a class.

Three important kinds of classes:
- Concrete classes
- Abstract classes
- Classes in class hierarchies

# Concrete Types

The _concrete classes_ behave _"just like built-in types"_, but they are more flexible and better behave (e.g. `vector`, `string`).

Their defining characteristic is that its representation is part of its definition. That leads to optimal performance in terms of time and space. We can:
- Place the on the stack, in statically allocated memory, and in other objects
- Refer to objects directly (no need of pointers or references)
- Good object initialization (using constructors)
- Copy and move objects

The trade-off of having concrete classes behave like built-in types is that if the representation changes, you must recompile.

A concrete type can keep major parts of its representation on the free store (dynamically allocated memory, heap).

## An Arithmetic Type

One classic example is the `complex` class:
```cpp
class complex {
    double re, im; // representation: two doubles
public:
    complex(double r, double i) :re{r}, im{i} {} // construct complex from two scalars
    complex(double r) :re{r}, im{0} {} // construct complex from one scalar
    complex() :re{0}, im{0} {} // default complex: {0,0}
    complex(complex z) :re{z.re}, im{z.im} {} // copy constructor

    double real() const { return re; }
    void real(double d) { re=d; }
    double imag() const { return im; }
    void imag(double d) { im=d; }

    complex& operator+=(complex z)
    {
	    re+=z.re; // add to re and im
        im+=z.im;
        return *this; // return the result
        }

    complex& operator-=(complex z)
    {
        re-=z.re;
        im-=z.im;
        return *this;
    }

    complex& operator*=(complex); // defined out-of-class somewhere
    complex& operator/=(complex); // defined out-of-class somewhere
};
```
Simple operations must be _inlined_. 

Function defined in a class are inlined by default. In any other case, you can explicitly request it, using the keyword `inline`.

A constructor that can be invoked without an argument is called a _default constructor_.

`const` member functions can be invoked for both `const` and non-`const` objects. But, non-`const` member functions only for non-`const` objects.

User-defined operator (_overloaded operator_) should be used in consideration.

## A Container
A _container_ is an object that holds elements (e.g. `vector`) and maybe provides `size()` to iterate over its elements.

`Vector`'s _constructor_ allocates some memory on the free store (_heap_ or dynamically allocated memory) and the complement(`~`) mechanism, the _constructor_ deallocates it.

This is known as _RAII_ and is better than having naked `new` and naked `delete`. Because the code is less error prone and resource leaks are prevented.

## Initializing Containers

Two favorite ways to store elements in a container:
1. _Initializer-list constructor_: `{}`-list.
2. `push_back()`: add new element at the back of the sequence

Unfortunately, the standard-library uses `unsigned` integers for sizes and subscripts. If we want to convert it to `int`, we could use `static_cast`. This is needed rarely, because they allow a relative big number of elements.

__Caution__: `static_cast` doesn't check the value it is converting. They are error-prone.

Other cast are `reinterpret_cast` and `bit_cast` for treating an object simply as a sequence of bytes.

`const_cast` is for "casting away `const`"

# Abstract Types

_Abstract type_ is the opposite of _concrete type_.

The __representation__ of concrete types is part of their __definition__.

In an _abstract type_, we have to __decouple the interface from the representation__ and give up genuine local variables.

Since we don't know anything about them (not even its size), we must allocate objects on the __free store__ and access them though __references and pointer__.

The word `virtual` means _"may be redefined later in a class derived from this one"_.

If there is the `=0`, then it's a __pure virtual__. In the aforementioned definition replace __"may"__ with __"must"__.

A class with a pure virtual function is called an abstract class. It can only serve as the interface to a derived class that implements the virtual functions.

A class that provides the interface to a variety of other classes  is often called a _polymorphic type_.

An abstract class may not have a constructor, because it doesn't have any data to initialize, but it has a destructor. The destructor is virtual because an abstract class is manipulated through references and pointers, so we don't now what resources are owned by its implementation.

The `:public` can be read as _"is derived from"_ or _"is a subtype of"_.

The __derived__ class _"is derived from"_ the __base__ class.

Also, we can call the derived class as __subclass__ and the base class as __superclass__.

The use of these classes is referred to as __inheritance__.

The derived class inherits __members__ from its base class. These member functions are said to __override__ the corresponding members in the base class. The use of keyword `override` is optional, but you should use it, because it helps the compiler and the code is less error-prone.

The flip side of the abstract type's flexibility is that the objects must be manipulated through pointers or references.

# Virtual Functions

The compiler converts the name of a virtual function into an index into a table of pointers to functions. That table is usually called the _virtual function table_ (`vtbl`).

Each class with virtual functions has its own `vtbl`.

Each row of the table corresponds to one virtual function. 

The function in the `vtbl` allow the object to be used correctly even if we don't know its size and the layout of its data. The caller needs only to know the function's index.

It's almost as efficient as a _normal function call_ mechanism. And it's cheaper for multiple calls.

Concerning the space, it only needs a pointer in each object and the aforementioned `vtbl`.

---
# Class Hierarchies

A _class hierarchy_ is a set of classes ordered in lattice created by derivation.

Naturally, the interface is an abstract class: concerning representation, _nothing_ (except pointer location to the `vtbl`) is common for every derived class. 

## Benefits from Hierarchies

1. _Interface Inheritance_: The base class acts like interface; whenever an object of the base class is required, an object of the derived class can be used.
2. _Implementation Inheritance_: A base class provides functions or data that simplifies the implementation of derived classes.

_Concrete classes_ are like built-in types: we define them as local variables, access them using their names, copy their names etc.

But we allocate classes in class hierarchies on the free store, using `new` and access them using pointers and references.

One more benefit is that, a function using an abstract class is compiled only once.

This function has the responsibility to deallocate the abstract pointer (if no pointers or references are used). Using the `delete` keyword, we call the _virtual destructor_, which invokes the destructor of the derived class.

Objects are __constructed__ `->` __bottom up__ (base first)
Objects are __destructed__ `->` __top down__ (derived first)

## Hierarchy Navigation

If we want to check if the object of an __abstract__ class is the object of a specific __derived__ class, we can use the `dynamic_cast` operator. If it isn't, it returns `nullptr`.

If a type is unacceptable, we can use `dynamic_cast` to a __reference__ type. So if it isn't the desired type, it throws a `bad_cast` exception.

_Operations similar to `dynamic_cast` are known as __"is kind of"__ or __"is instance of"__ operations._

## Avoiding Resource Leaks

__Leak__: We acquire a resource and fail to release it.

leak `->` resource unavailable to the system `->` slowdown or even crash

__Caution__: If there is a `throw` or `return` before deallocating a pointer (`delete`), then this maybe leads to a _leak_.

__Simple solution__: Use a standard-library __unique_ptr__ rather than a "naked pointer". A pleasant side effect is that we don't have to define a destructor for the __derived__ class.

# Advice

1. Express ideas directly in code.
2. A concrete type is the simplest kind of class. Where applicable, prefer a concrete type over more complicated classes and over plain data structures.
3. Use concrete classes to represent simple concepts.
4. Prefer concrete classes over class hierarchies for performance-critical components.
5. Define constructors to handle initialization of objects.
6. Make a function a member only if it needs direct access to the representation of a class.
7. Define operators primarily to mimic conventional usage.
8. Use nonmember functions for systematic operators.
9. Declare a member function that does not modify the state of its object `const`.
10. If a constructor acquires a resource, its class needs a destructor to release the resource.
11. Avoid "naked" `new` and `delete` operations.
12. Use resource handles and RAII to manage resources.
13. If a class is a container, give it an initializer-list constructor.
14. Use abstract classes as interfaces when complete separation of interface and implementation is needed.
15. Access polymorphic objects through pointers and references.
16. An abstract class typically doesn't need a constructor.
17. Use class hierarchies to represent concepts with inherent hierarchical structure.
18. A class with a virtual function should have a virtual destructor.
19. Use `override` to make overriding explicit in large class hierarchies.
20. When designing a class hierarchy, distinguish between implementation inheritance and interface inheritance
21. Use `dynamic_cast` where class hierarchy navigation is unavoidable.
22. Use `dynamic_cast` to a reference type when failure to find the required class is considered a failure.
23. Use `dynamic_cast` to a pointer type when failure to find the required class is considered a valid alternative.
24. Use `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` to avoid forgetting to `delete` objects created using `new`.
