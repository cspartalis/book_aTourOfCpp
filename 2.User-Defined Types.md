# Introduction
___

C++ built-in types are deliberately low-level. But C++ acquires _abstraction mechanisms_ that allow the programmer to built _user-defined types_.

User-defined types are referred to as _classes and enumerations_.

User-defined types vs built-in types:
- Easier to use
- Less error-prone
- Just as efficient, or even more

# Structures
---

The `new` operator allocates memory from an area called the _free store_ (also known as _dynamic memory_ and _heap_).

Objects allocated on the free store are independent of the scope from which they are created and "live" until they are destroyed using the `delete` operator.

Use `.`(dot) to access struct members through a name (and a reference). And `->` to access struct members through a pointer.

---
# Classes
---

A _class_ is a language mechanism that distinguishes between the interface to a type (to be used by all) and its implementation (which has access to the otherwise inaccessible data).

(The _interface_ is a way to describe the behavior of a class without committing to the implementation of the class.)

The interface of a class is define by it `public` and `private` members. Conventionally, the private parts come after the public ones.

The `private` parts are accessible only through that interface.

_Constructor_ is a function that guarantees to initialize objects of its class. Thus, using a constructor eliminates the problem of uninitialized variables for a class.

The book's example uses a _member initializer list_. I copied just the constructor of the class named Vector:

`Vector(int s) :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} {}`

In the book's example there is a subscript function, called `operator[]` that return a reference to the appropriate element. And it is noted that a `double&` allows both reading and writing.

A `struct` is simply a `class` with members public by default.

# Enumerations
---

_Enumerations_ represent small sets of integer values. Their consÎ¾:
- They make code more readable
- Less error-prone

By default an `enum class` has:
- assignment
- initialization
- comparisons (`==`, `<`)

But as a user-defined type, we can define more operators for it.

If you don't want to explicitly qualify enumerator names and want enumerator values to be integers (without the need of explicit conversion), you can remove the `class` from the `enum class`.

# 2.5 Unions
---

A `union` is a `struct` in which all members are allocated at the same address, so that the `union` occupies only as much as space as its largest member. Naturally, it can hold only one member at a time.

For many uses, a `variant` is simpler and safer to use than a `union`.

A `variant` is a standard library type that stores a value of one of a set of alternative types.

# 2.6 Advice
---

(The following are copied from the book)
1. Prefer well-defined user-defined types over built-in types when the built-in types are too low-level.
2. Organize related data into structures (struct or classes).
3. Represent the distinction between an interface and an implementation using a class.
4. A struct is simply a class with its members public by default.
5. Define constructors to guarantee and simplify initialization of classes.
6. Use enumerations to represent sets of named constants.
7. Prefer class enums over "plain" enums to minimize surprises.
8. Define operations on enumerations for safe and simple use.
9. Avoid "naked" unions; wrap them in a class together with a type field.
10. Prefer `std::variant` to "naked unions".
