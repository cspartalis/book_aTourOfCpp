# Introduction

The major tool of C++ to handle errors is the higher level constructs (e.g. string, map, thread, sort(), find_if(), draw_all()) instead of built-in types (e.g. char, int, double).

One effect of these abstractions is the separation of runtime error detection and handling.

__Tip__: Articulate an error handling strategy when you start developing a program.

# Exceptions

E.g. `throw out_of_range{"..."};`

The `throw` transfers control to a handler for exceptions. The implementation will _unwind_ the function call stack to get back to the context of the caller. The exception handling mechanism will exit scopes and functions to get back to the caller, invoking destructors along the way as needed.

Inside the scope of a function, we can use the `try` and `catch` blocks. We put the code for which we are interested in handling exceptions int a try-block.

`out_of_range` type is defined in the standard library (`<stdexcept>`).

We can catch the exception by reference to avoid copying and use the `what()` function to print it.

The main technique for making error handling simple and systematic is __RAII__ (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). The constructor acquires the resources necessary for a class to operate, and the destructor releases all of them.
