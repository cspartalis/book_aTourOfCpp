# Introduction

The major tool of C++ to handle errors is the higher level constructs (e.g. string, map, thread, sort(), find_if(), draw_all()) instead of built-in types (e.g. char, int, double).

One effect of these abstractions is the separation of runtime error detection and handling.

__Tip__: Articulate an error handling strategy when you start developing a program.

# Exceptions

E.g. `throw out_of_range{"..."};`

The `throw` transfers control to a handler for exceptions. The implementation will _unwind_ the function call stack to get back to the context of the caller. The exception handling mechanism will exit scopes and functions to get back to the caller, invoking destructors along the way as needed.

Inside the scope of a function, we can use the `try` and `catch` blocks. We put the code for which we are interested in handling exceptions int a try-block.

`out_of_range` type is defined in the standard library (`<stdexcept>`).

We can catch the exception by reference to avoid copying and use the `what()` function to print it.

The main technique for making error handling simple and systematic is __RAII__ (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). The constructor acquires the resources necessary for a class to operate, and the destructor releases all of them.

# Invariants

_Class invariant_ (or simply _invariant_): what is assumed to be true for a class.

It's the job of the constructor to establish the invariants of its class.

_Memory exhaustion_: You ask more memory than the machine can offer.

Modern operating systems typically will give you more space than will fit in physical memory (maybe the author refers to swap memory), __but__ this can cause serious slowdown before triggering `bad_alloc`.

To deal with it, you can define your own classes to be used as exceptions. It is not necessary to use the standard-library exception hierarchy.

In well-designed code `try`-blocks are rare. Avoid overuse by systematically using __RAII__ technique.

# Error-Handling Alternatives

If an error occurs in a function and cannot be handled locally, then it should be communicated to some caller. Throwing an exception is the most common mechanism.

In `C++` exceptions are designed to report failure to complete a given task and not as an alternate mechanism for returning values.

How to report an error that cannot be handled locally:
1. Throw an exception
2. Return a value indicating failure
3. Terminate the program (`terminate()`, `exit()`, or `abort()`)

When to return an __error code__:
1. A failure is normal (e.g. request to open a file usually fails due to lack of permissions or the file itself)
2. An immediate caller can handle the failure
3. An error happens in one of a set of parallel tasks
4. _A system has so little memory that the run-time support for exceptions would crowd out essential functionality_

When to __throw__ an exception:
1. An error is rare, so the programmer probably will forget to check it (e.g. return value of `printf()`).
2. The error cannot be handled by an immediate caller and has to percolate back up the call chain to an "ultimate caller". Checking multiple error codes as return values is not good practice.
3. New kind of errors can be added to lower-modules of an application so the higher-modules won't cope with these errors. For example, modifying a single-threaded application to use multiple threads, or resources are placed remotely to be accessed over network.
4. Not suitable return path for error codes. E.g. a constructor doesn't have a return value for a "caller" to check.
5. The return path of a function will become too complicated by a need to pass both a value and an error indicator (e.g. a `pair`).
6. The recovery from errors depends on the results of several function calls.
7. _The function that found the error was a callback (a function argument), so the immediate caller may not even know what function was called._
8. An error implies that some "undo action" is needed.

When to __terminate__:
1. We cannot recover from an error (e.g. usually in memory exhaustion).
2. It's a non-trivial error that needs restarting a thread, process, or computer.

One way to ensure termination of a function is to add `noexcept`, but this shouldn't be a general practice. When in doubt use _exceptions_.

__Tip__: Do not believe the myth that exception handling is slow.

_RAII is essential for simple and efficient error-handling using exceptions._

# Assertions

There is no general and standard way of writing run-time tests of invariants, preconditions etc.

There are many ad hoc mechanisms, that need to be flexible, general, and imply no cost when enabled.

The author suggests a flexible and trivial scheme:
```cpp
enum class Error_action { ignore, throwing, terminating, logging }; // error-handling alternatives

constexpr Error_action default_Error_action = Error_action::throwing; // a default

enum class Error_code { range_error, length_error }; // individual errors

string error_code_name[] { "range error", "length error" }; // names of individual errors

template<Error_action action = default_Error_action, class C> constexpr void expect(C cond, Error_code x) // take "action" if the expected condition "cond" doesn't hold

{
	if constexpr (action == Error_action::logging)
		if (!cond()) std::cerr << "expect() failure: " << int(x) << '' << error_code_name[int(x)] << '\n';
	if constexpr (action == Error_action::throwing)
		if (!cond()) throw x;
	if constexpr (action == Error_action::terminating)
		if (!cond()) terminate();
	 // or no action
}
```

Example:
```cpp
double& Vector::operator[](int i)
{
	expect([i,this] { return 0<=i && i<size(); }, Error_code::range_error);
	return elem[i];
}
```

## `assert()`

It's a debug macro, pretty crude and inflexible, but often better than nothing.

```cpp
void f(const char* p)
{
	assert(p!=nullptr);
	// ...
}
```

If the condition of an `assert()` fails in "debug mode", the program terminates.

## Static Assertions

Exception report errors found at run time.

The `static_assert` mechanism checks on most properties that are known at compile time and report failures as compiler error messages.

## `noexcept`

A function that should never throw an exception can be declared `noexcept`.

It should be applied with caution!

# Advice

1. Throw an exception to indicate that you cannot perform an assigned task.
2. Use exceptions for error handling only.
3. Failing to open a file or to reach the end of an iteration are expected events and not exceptional.
4. Use error codes when an immediate caller is expected to handle the error.
5. Throw an exception for errors expected to percolate up through many function calls.
6. If in doubt whether to use an exception or an error code, prefer exceptions.
7. Develop an error-handling strategy early in a design.
8. Use purpose-designed user-defined types as exceptions (not built-in types).
9. Don't try to catch every exception in every function.
10. You don't have to use the standard-library exception class hierarchy.
11. Prefer RAII to explicit `try`-blocks.
12. Let a constructor establish an invariant, and throw if it cannot.
13. Design your error-handling strategy around invariants.
14. What can be checked at compile time is usually best checked at compile time.
15. Use an assertion mechanism to provide a single point of control of the meaning of failure.
16. Concepts are compile-time predicates and therefore often useful in assertions.
17. If your function may not throw, declare it `noexcept`.
18. Don't apply `noexcept` thoughtlessly.
